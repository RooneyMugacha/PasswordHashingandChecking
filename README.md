# PasswordHashingandChecking
This project demonstrates how to securely hash a password using Python's hashlib library and check if the hashed password matches any password in a list stored in a .txt file. This can be useful for scenarios such as password validation, where we compare the hash of the user input with a pre-stored list of hashed passwords.
